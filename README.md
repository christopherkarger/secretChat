## SecretChat
An anonymous chat.
Create a new firebase project.
Replace your config with the one in jsModules/firebase and host the build files somewhere on a server.

## How it works!
Create a new chat. Set a password and send the link to your friend.
If you loose the password or the URL, the chat will be encrypted forever and no one can decrypt the messages again.
Please be aware that the password is NOT stored somewhere, neither in the database, nor on the webserver.

Feel free the modify the code!

Have Fun and happy coding.
